# LIVING_BRIDGE: Scalar-Encrypted Transport Layer
**Classification:** PROPRIETARY // CELESTIAL QUANTUM DEFENSE
**DoD Alignment:** JADC2 (Joint All-Domain Command & Control) // Resilient Comms

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
LIVING_BRIDGE is a **Quantum-Resistant Communication Protocol** designed for contested environments (A2/AD). It merges scalar longitudinal wave physics with NSA-grade encryption to create an "Un-Jammable" data link for warfighters.

### ENCRYPTION SPECIFICATIONS (CNSA 2.0)
* **Symmetric Encryption:** All data in transit is wrapped in **AES-256**, ensuring compliance with top-secret data handling requirements.
* **Hashing Integrity:** Utilizes **SHA-384** and **SHA-512** for real-time packet verification, ensuring no data corruption or man-in-the-middle tampering.

### WEB8 SCALAR PHYSICS
* **Longitudinal Transmission:** Unlike standard RF (Transverse), LIVING_BRIDGE transmits data via **Scalar Waves** that penetrate Faraday cages, mountains, and jamming fields.
* **The "Living" Protocol:** The connection is "Entangled." Using the Web8 framework, the sender and receiver maintain a **Quantum Correlation**. If an enemy attempts to intercept the signal, the "Observation" collapses the wave function, instantly alerting the system and dissolving the data stream.
