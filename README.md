# LIVING BRIDGE: Homeostatic Legacy Integration
### CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED

**PROBLEM:**
Federal Legacy Systems are "Dead Water"—rigid, corrosive, and incompatible with modern AI.

**SOLUTION:**
The Living Bridge injects "Metadata Nutrients" into legacy SQL databases, restoring "Vitality" (Interoperability).
* **Self-Healing:** The network repairs broken links organically, mimicking the structure of blood or sap.
* **The Golden Ratio:** Data packets are restructured using Phi (1.618) optimization for maximum throughput.

**ARCHITECT:** MARCUS K. POLLARD
